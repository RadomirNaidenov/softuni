                    Tim laid out his vision for what would become the
                    web in a document called “Information Management: A
                    Proposal”. Believe it or not, Tim’s initial proposal
                    was not immediately accepted. In fact, his boss at
                    the time, Mike Sendall, noted the words “Vague but
                    exciting” on the cover.

                    Tim had written the three fundamental technologies
                    that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which
                    you may have seen appear on parts of your web
                    browser): HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The
                    markup (formatting) language for the web. URI:
                    Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address”
                    that is unique and used to identify to each resource
                    on the web. It is also commonly called a URL. HTTP:
                    Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the
                    retrieval of linked resources from across the web.
